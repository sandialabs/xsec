ENDF/B-VIII.0 Final (2 Feb 2018)
--------------------------------
There were a lot of changes in this release, but they were mostly all cosmetic!

CIELO Files:

    * n-008_O_016.endf: Make 1/v portion of capture cross section log-log
      interpolatable, then use LINEAR and FIXUP to ensure the total cross
      section is the sum of partial cross sections

    * n-026_Fe_056.endf: Final CIELO documentation for 56Fe, including
      lists of experiments used

    * n-094_Pu_239.endf: Corrected covariance (MF32 not overlapping with MF33
      anymore) and correct zeros in distribution for (n,4n)


Other Standards 2017 Files:

    * n-003_Li_007.endf
        - ensure total == sum of parts by running LINEAR and FIXUP
        - Fix several MF=4 and MF=5 files so that the tabulated energy range
          *exactly* matches that of the corresponding cross sections

    * n-006_C_013.endf, n-006_C_012.endf: Ensure total cross section is
      consistent with sum of partials using LINEAR and FIXUP

    * n-079_Au_197.endf: correct URR redundant cross sections for consistency,
      minor change to capture, elastic and total to bring into *exact*
      agreement with Standards evaluation


Other Evaluations:

    * n-004_Be_009.endf
        - Adjust MT=1 interpolation for first 10 points to eliminate
          mismatch between total cross section and sum of partials
        - Fix first energy point mismatch between cross section and
          outgoing distributions in MT=16

    * n-024_Cr_051.endf, n-078_Pt_190.endf: attempt to correct BR in (n,n')
      levels so probabilites sum to 1

    * n-026_Fe_054.endf: Final documentation and covariances

    * n-026_Fe_057.endf, n-026_Fe_057.endf: Final documentation

    * n-050_Sn_126.endf: remove fission width flag

    * n-092_U_241.endf: Ensure that the total cross section equals the sum of
      partial cross sections using LINEAR and FIXUP, this fixes a major flaw in
      the total cross section -- a large bump near 1e-5 eV, the result of a
      mis-application of log-log interpolation

    * n-093_Np_236m1.endf: Fix the evaluation date -- I'm pretty sure the
      evaluation was not performed in 2027

    * n-008_O_017.endf, n-011_Na_023.endf, n-018_Ar_038.endf, n-020_Ca_046.endf,

      n-084_Po_210.endf, n-094_Pu_245.endf, n-098_Cf_247.endf
        - Update documentation to include information about source of resonances
        - Ensure total cross section equals sum of partials using LINEAR and FIXUP


ENDF/B-VIII.0beta7 (16 Jan 2018)
--------------------------------

CIELO Files:
    * n-026_Fe_056.endf: Correct the resonance region covariances, adding fully
      correlated "background" covariance of 2% uncertainty in the Fe window region in
      capture and otherwise properly treating the uncertainties given in Atlas

    * n-092_U_235.endf, n-092_U_238.endf: Extended fission energy release energy ranges
      to match the cross section energy range (Thanks Wim!)

    * n-094_Pu_239.endf: Final version of 239Pu from LANL, with improved covariances and
      documentation.  Additionally, the following two fixes were made:
        - Extended fission energy release energy ranges to match the cross section energy
          range (Thanks Wim!),
        - Fix date format in the EDATE field of MF=1 MT=451


Other Standards 2017 Files:

    * n-005_B_010.endf: Fix documentation for B10 changes made in Sept. 2017

    * n-006_C_013.endf: Fix date format in the EDATE field of MF=1 MT=451

Other Evaluations:

    * n-028_Ni_058.endf  Ni58 MT=103 MF=33 contained 3 sub-sections, using LB=5, 4 and 1.
      The LB=4 subsection appeared to contain negative variances, although after combining
      with other subsections the resulting matrix is fine. To avoid confusion, replace
      with a single LB=5 subsection containing the union grid of the three old subsections.

    * n-025_Mn_054.endf  Remove duplicate points from outgoing energy distribution for
      V49 in MF6 MT5


ENDF/B-VIII.0beta6 (15 Dec 2017)
--------------------------------

CIELO files:

    * n-008_O_016.endf: Add covariance for many channels.  We suspect format problems
      remain.

    * n-026_Fe_056.endf, Three fixes:
        - Restore MF12 files and tweak energy ranges of MF4 files
        - Add covariance sections to indicate what reactions are included in lumped-sum
          covariance MT851
        - Fix previous commit: per discussion with Gustavo and others, MT851 should be
          the sum of MTs 800-818 rather than 52-91

    * n-092_U_235.endf:  Add P(nu) data, fission energy release and covariances,
      including a correction to the nubar and PFNS covariance.  In addition,
       - The PFNS energy mesh was densified to avoid "ripples" in the ratio to Maxwellian.
       - The high-energy tail (>10 MeV) was slightly modified (~3% at 14 MeV) to be more
         consistent with the description in the papers.
       - The PFNS thermal covariance matrix was wrong (=e71). The GMA fit with extensions
         was cast into a form that produces reasonable covariance matrices in different
         energy structures.
      There should be no impact on the benchmarking.

    * n-092_U_238.endf: Add P(nu) data, fission energy release and covariances,
      including a correction to the nubar and PFNS covariance.

    * n-094_Pu_239.endf, Two changes:
        - Updated covariances: capture uncertainties at higher energy and nubar
          uncertainty at fission spectrum energies
        - Added P1(mu) covariance for MT=2

    * The MT 458 sections for U235 and U238 have been updated:

        The IFC == 1 EFR Energy of fission fragments
        TAB1 record contains the new total kinetic energy (TKE) evaluation from
        Bates and Lestone.

        The following values are computed to correspond to the primary evaluated
        data corresponding to the previous committed version.

        IFC == 2 ENP Energy of prompt neutrons
        Computed as <En> from PFNS (MF5/MT18) * prompt nubar (MF1/MT456)

        IFC == 3 END Energy of delayed neutrons
        Computed as <En> from DFNS (MF5/MT455) * delayed nubar (MF1/MT455)

        IFC == 4 ENP Energy of prompt neutrons
        Computed as <En> from PFGS (MF15/MT18) * gamma multiplicity (MF12/MT18)

        Corresponding entries in LIST record for thermal values have also been
        updated. Note that uncertainties on thermal values still need to have
        reasonable values agreed upon and entered (based on ongoing covariance
        work).


Other Standards 2017 Files:

    * n-003_Li_006.endf: Supposed to be the beta5 version, with covariances, but was
      misplaced.

    * n-005_B_010.endf: Fix gap in (n,el) covariance

    * n-006_C_012.endf: Revised from Hale & Paris: natC evaluation restored from 20-150 MeV.
      Also, correct energy range of capture cross section so matches outgoing gamma line
      energy range

    * n-006_C_013.endf: Corrected covariance data (was previously in 12C, not here)


Other Evaluations:

    * n-000_n_001.endf:  Extend evaluation to 50 MeV

    * n-026_Fe_054.endf: Tweak starting energies of tables to be consistent with
      multiplicities and cross sections for several reactions

    * n-026_Fe_057.endf, Two fixes:
        - Restore MF12 energies to correct values
        - Correct the channel L values so that parity is conserved

    * n-026_Fe_058.endf: Restore MF12 energies to correct values from beta4.1

    * n-029_Cu_063.endf, Three fixes:
        - Fix MF32 MT151 spin group headers
        - Fix MT63 sum of gamma branchings in MF12
        - Correct covariance matrix CONT records in MF32 for LRF=7 resonances

    * n-029_Cu_065.endf: Correct covariance matrix CONT records in MF32 for LRF=7 resonances

    * n-076_Os_191.endf: Fix first section of MF=40 MT=4 in Os191. It should refer to
      production of the ground state rather than 1st excited

    * Correct covariance matrix CONT records in MF32 for LRF=7 resonances for
      n-074_W_182.endf, n-074_W_183.endf, n-074_W_184.endf, n-074_W_186.endf

    * Update ZAP and IZAP in MF=8, 10 and 40 for sub-actinide fission. Per recent ENDF format
      update, ZAP = -1 indicates the total fission cross section.  Impacts n-074_W_182.endf,
      n-074_W_183.endf, n-074_W_184.endf, n-074_W_186.endf, n-076_Os_191.endf,
      n-077_Ir_192.endf, n-078_Pt_190.endf, n-078_Pt_191.endf, n-078_Pt_192.endf,
      n-078_Pt_193.endf, n-078_Pt_194.endf, n-078_Pt_195.endf, n-078_Pt_196.endf,
      n-078_Pt_197.endf, n-078_Pt_198.endf, n-080_Hg_203.endf, n-081_Tl_204.endf,
      n-082_Pb_205.endf, n-084_Po_208.endf, and n-084_Po_210.endf

    * Making changes to a handful of isotopes that failed to process through NJOY's
      GROUPR module.  Each of these files has an inconsistency in the MF/MT=6/5 LIP data.
      When there is more than 1 excited state, the LIP value must be incremented. For each of
      these, the LIP value was 0,2,3,.... The LIP=1 value was skipped over, thus causing NJOY
      to fail because it couldn't find the correct nuclide.  Additionally, fix MF=8 MT=4
      sections for several isotopes, removing an incorrectly identified isomeric
      state. MF=8 MT=5 had the correct set of isomers, causing a mismatch between MT=4 and 5.
      Impacted: n-036_Kr_081.endf, n-042_Mo_093.endf, n-077_Ir_192.endf, n-078_Pt_193.endf,
      n-078_Pt_195.endf, and n-078_Pt_197.endf



ENDF/B-VIII.0beta5 (2 Oct 2017)
-------------------------------

CIELO files:

    * n-001_H_001.endf: Covariances added

    * n-008_O_016.endf: Covariances added

    * n-026_Fe_056.endf: Covariances added

    * n-092_U_235.endf (Corresponds to IAEA u235ib46o28t6DNcnu5ef0STz5):
        Corrected PFNS covariance from D. Neudecker

    * n-092_U_238.endf (orresponds to IAEA version u238ib58lrlFsfaST4n):
        ** Covariances added
        ** Latest U238 multiplicity and PFGS spectra from Ionel Stetcu.
           These correspond to the plots and tables in the ENDF/B-VIII.0
           'big paper' revision 272.

    * n-094_Pu_239.endf
        ** Marco Pigni took the  covariance file (MF=32) from the JEFF-3.2 library and
           modified by minor corrections such as the last digits of the resonance energy
           parameters that did not match those ones in file 2.  The covariance file is
           coupled to the resonance evaluation extracted in the frame of the WPEC/SG34
           working group NEA/NSC/WPEC/DOC(2014)447. The file 32 also contains the
           uncertainty on the scattering radius (about 1.8%) that is almost double than
           one estimated in the ATLAS. Although this uncertainty seems overestimated, the
           file 32 was kept as originally released in the JEFF-3.2 for consistency.
        ** Latest U238 multiplicity and PFGS spectra from Ionel Stetcu.
           These correspond to the plots and tables in the ENDF/B-VIII.0
           'big paper' revision 272.

    * The U235, U238 and Pu239 components of fission energy release (MT458) have been updated.

        The total average fission fragment kinetic energy [EFR] is given as tabular data
        using IFC 1. These are evaluated data by Bates and Lestone as described in the
        ENDF/B-VIII.0 'big paper'.

        The total average prompt fission neutron energy [ENP], total average
        delayed fission neutron energy, [END] and total average prompt fission
        gamma energy [EGP] are given as tabular data using IFC 2, 3 and 4,
        respectively, where the values are computed to be self-consistent with the
        corresponding emission distribution data.

        More specifically, the tabular data are:
        LDRV == 2, IFC == 1    evaluated TKE data
        LDRV == 1, IFC == 2    <En> from PFNS (MF5/MT18 or equivalent) * prompt nubar (MF1/MT456)
        LDRV == 1, IFC == 3    <En> from DFNS (MF5/MT455) * delayed nubar (MF1/MT455)
        LDRV == 1, IFC == 4    <En> from PFGS (MF15/MT18) * gamma multiplicity (MF12/MT18)

        The computed data correspond to the last revision of the evaluations before this
        update, that is

        U235  MF1 MT458 IFC 2,3,4 are computed from r1333
        U238  MF1 MT458 IFC 2,3,4 are computed from r1333
        Pu239 MF1 MT458 IFC 2,3,4 are computed from r1329

Other Standards 2017 Files:

    * n-005_B_010.endf
        ** Added covariances, including first pass at high energy extension to the
           covariance, based on the ENDF/B-VII.1
        ** For n + B10 -> t + (Be8 -> 2a), MF=6 gives an explicit distribution for the
           triton, then uses LAW=4 (recoil) for the two alphas. Recoil doesn't make sense
           in a breakup reaction (unless a distribution was assigned to one alpha and the
           other one treated as recoiling from that). For now use LAW=0 (unknown) instead.

    * n-006_C_012.endf: Added covariances

Other Evaluations:

    * n-001_H_002.endf:
        Modified MF33, MT2 in the lowest energy bin to have a solid physical limit for
        (n,tot) and (n,n).  In the new version submitted to beta5, the uncertainty of
        total and elastic cross sections are the same, = +/- 1.5%,
        at 1.0e-5 eV < E < 1.0e+5 eV (lowest energy bin), because
        sig(n,g) <<< sig(n,tot) for H-2 ;  the correlation matrix based on MF33, MT2 is
        kept unchanged (so the non-diagonal elements cov(1,i), i >= 2, are re-scaled).

    * n-002_He_004.endf: Adjust documentation

    * n-025_Mn_055.endf: Adjust documentation

    * n-026_Fe_054.endf
        ** Extend file to 150 MeV
        ** Add dosimetry reactions

    * n-026_Fe_057.endf: Extend file to 150 MeV

    * n-026_Fe_058.endf
        ** Tweak energy range of inelastic angular distributions to match cross section data
        ** Extend file to 150 MeV

    * n-045_Rh_103.endf
        ** In the thermal range the uncertainty for capture was given as 0.034.
           The Atlas value is 143.5 +/- 1.5, or an uncertainty of 0.01045.
           The covariance matrix was changed  accordingly.
        ** Fix bound level total width so that it equals the sum of partials

    * n-061_Pm_147.endf
        For Pm147 the relative uncertainty for capture in the RI range was 0.25.
        The Atlas value is: 2064 +/- 100, or 0.048 relative. The value in the covariance
        matrix was changed to give this result.

    * n-062_Sm_149.endf
        In the thermal range the uncertainty for capture was given as 0.05. The Atlas value
        is 4014 +/- 600, or an uncertainty of 0.0149. The covariance matrix was changed accordingly.

    * n-062_Sm_151.endf
        In the thermal range the uncertainty for capture was given as 0.07. The Atlas value

ENDF/B-VIII.0beta4.1 (2 Sep 2017)
---------------------------------

CIELO fixes:

    * n-008_O_016.endf:
        ** Remove line numbers, and remove duplicate points near the start of MF3 MT1
        ** MF33 MT800 contains a section claiming to be a cross-term with MT107. However,
           the matrix is symmetric and the file contains no MT107 covariance, leading me
           to assume that this section is purely for MT800

    * n-026_Fe_056.endf: "final" CIELO mean values, not including IRDFF cross section merge

    * n-092_U_235.endf: Revised CIELO 235U with modified fission cross section and nubar.
      Corresponds to IAEA version u235ib46o28t6DNcnu5ef0STz.

    * n-092_U_238.endf: Final version of CIELO 238U sans covariance data and PFGS.
      Corresponds to IAEA version u238ib58lrlFsfaST4h.

    * n-094_Pu_239.endf: update header; make fission Q values agree with fission energy release

Big, non-CIELO changes:

    * Remove elemental Carbon (n-006_C_000.endf) now that we have 12C and 13C evaluations

    * n-001_H_002.endf: IAEA/CNL change to 2H: replace elastic scattering angular
      distribution with that from JEFF-3.3T

Many fixes made during the 2017 Hackathon:

    * Americium:
        ** n-095_Am_242m1.endf make two nearly degenerate levels slightly less degenerate
        ** n-095_Am_244m1.endf, n-095_Am_244.endf: ensure angular distribution is positive

    * Arsenic:
        ** n-033_As_073.endf, n-033_As_074.endf: Fix interpolation of MT 1,2,102 background
           cross sections in transition from RRR to URR & fast also fix NMOD &  the MT107
           Q value in 73As

    * Copper:
        ** n-029_Cu_065.endf: Added one space to Cu-65 TPID. This fixes issue #1086.
        ** n-029_Cu_065.endf: remove extra character on the first line

    * Curium:
        ** n-096_Cm_248.endf: remove duplicate point in angular distribution and tweak
           energy value of MT57 level
        ** n-096_Cm_243.endf: nudge one (n,n') energy level so it's no longer a duplicate
           level (MT=54) nudge one incident energy in the (n,el) angular distribution so
           that it's no longer a duplicate

    * Erbium:
        ** n-068_Er_167.endf, n-068_Er_168.endf, n-068_Er_170.endf, n-068_Er_166.endf:
           Use LEGEND to convert MT=51-54 angular distributions to pointwise, then make
           them positive definite
        ** n-068_Er_162.endf, n-068_Er_170.endf: Fix various evaluations so that cross
           sections and distributions begin/end at same point

    * Gadolinium:
        ** n-064_Gd_152.endf: negative elastic scattering at low energies fixed by moving
           the low-energy (n,alpha) cross section to the total.
        ** n-064_Gd_154.endf: Nudge the energy of one of the resonance slightly to avoid
           having two resonances with identical resonance parameters. This makes it
           impossible to find the correct resonance for the covariance data.

    * Halfnium:
        ** n-072_Hf_174.endf: comment section added
        ** n-072_Hf_174.endf, n-072_Hf_176.endf, n-072_Hf_177.endf, n-072_Hf_178.endf,
           n-072_Hf_179.endf, n-072_Hf_180.endf: comment section modified

    * Iron:
        ** n-026_Fe_054.endf: turn off resonance shift factor, RECENT & FUDGE ignore it
        ** n-026_Fe_057.endf: Several small fixes to resonances:
            *** Fix Q value of MT 51 particle pairs to match MT 51 cross section
            *** Correct all channel parities, they were all multiplied by -1 (parity isn't
                used in cross section of angular distribution calcs, so this does nothing)
            *** Correct the SHF parameter to match the ENDF manual
            *** Correct the JPi=1+ spin group's potential scattering contribution by
                adding MT=2,51 channels
            *** Correct the JPi=2+ spin group's potential scattering contribution by
                adding an MT=51 channel
        ** n-026_Fe_054.endf, n-026_Fe_056.endf, n-026_Fe_058.endf: Fixed MF12/MF3 gamma
           energies in favor of MF3. Some now have 8 sig. digits in MF12

    * Tin:
        ** n-050_Sn_122.endf: fix interpolation in MT=1,2,102
        ** n-050_Sn_124.endf:  add back bound resonance at -176 eV (it was lost in
           revision 685) set interpolation flag to lin-lin (INT=2) for MT=1,2,102 cross
           sections to eliminate log(0) error spotted by FIZCON

    * Tungsten:
        ** n-074_W_180.endf, n-074_W_182.endf, n-074_W_183.endf: Fix incorrect excited
           state indices in MF 8/10 for W isotopes.  Closes tracker #788
        ** n-074_W_183.endf: Fix the channel spin parity flag in File 32 for W183.
           This was already fixed in File 2
        ** n-074_W_180.endf: Additional fix to W180 (MF=8 vs MF=10 level mismatch)

    * n-002_He_003.endf: Change interpolation on total cross section to log-log. Closes
      tracker #1082

    * n-004_Be_009.endf: change TPID on first line

    * n-005_B_010.endf:
        ** make angular distribution positive definate
        ** n-005_B_010.endf uses LR=22 in MT 700 to indicate the breakup of
           Be8 into two alphas.  According to the ENDF manual  (page 19 of the 2012
           edition), LRs 22-36 are provided for compatibility with ENDF/B-V.  LR=1 is
           preferred for new evaluations.  Since all products are explicitly listed in
           MF 6, this simply changes the LR flag to LR=1.

    * n-006_C_013.endf: eliminate degenerate energies in angular distributions and cross sections

    * n-017_Cl_035.endf: Close tracker 1066: Fix the SHF value from -1 to 0 for Cl35

    * n-018_Ar_040.endf: negative cross section at 978 keV fixed by increasing BG slightly

    * n-028_Ni_060.endf: double value at end of resonance region in (n,el) were not
      actually double, leading to negative cross section once resonances were reconstructed

    * n-041_Nb_093.endf: Fixed outgoing ZA error in 93Nb and AWR incorrect in resonance file

    * n-043_Tc_098.endf: Fix the j values for File 32 in the URR to be the same as given
      in File 2 for 98Tc

    * n-058_Ce_136.endf:  back-ground problem in the elastic and (n,alpha) cross sections fixed.

    * n-066_Dy_160.endf: MF3 MT3 removed and Fix negative elastic cross section

    * n-067_Ho_166m1.endf: tweak energy of level in MF12, MT811 to match level energy in MF3 MT811

    * n-092_U_241.endf: Change MT=3 gammas in U241. Previously the gamma production cross
      section increased linearly from 0 at 1e-5 eV to non-zero 100 keV, replacing that
      with a step function at 100 keV. Low-energy capture and fission gammas are given
      elsewhere, so it seems that MT=3 was double-counting.

    * n-098_Cf_249.endf: Fix degenerate 8th level in MT58, the level energy should have
      been 2.1 keV higher.  This fix applied to MF3, 6, and 33

    * Fixed MF12/MF3 gamma energies in favor of MF3. Some now have 8 sig. digits in MF12:

      n-036_Kr_081.endf, n-042_Mo_093.endf, n-076_Os_191.endf, n-077_Ir_192.endf,
      n-078_Pt_193.endf, n-052_Te_121m1.endf, n-053_I_132.endf, n-053_I_132m1.endf,
      n-052_Te_131.endf, n-052_Te_131m1.endf, n-052_Te_121.endf, n-052_Te_121m1.endf,
      n-047_Ag_118m1.endf, n-050_Sn_121m1.endf, n-058_Ce_137m1.endf, n-075_Re_186m1.endf,
      n-077_Ir_194m1.endf, n-083_Bi_210m1.endf

    * n-013_Al_026m1.endf: Fix issues with new Al26_m1 evaluation:
      MF=1 needs excited state energy, plus should indicate unstable nucleus
        - Remove non-zero values from reserved field in MF=4
        - ensure level indices are right in MF=8 and 10

    * Add correct MAT numbers to many new evaluations

    * Fix LDRV flag in many new evaluations (LDRV should be 0 unless the file is derived,
      application-specific data)

Added & corrected Pt evaluations from TENDL:

    * New files: n-078_Pt_190.endf, n-078_Pt_191.endf, n-078_Pt_192.endf,
      n-078_Pt_194.endf, n-078_Pt_195.endf, n-078_Pt_196.endf, n-078_Pt_197.endf,
      n-078_Pt_198.endf, n-078_Pt_193.endf

    * n-078_Pt_194.endf, n-078_Pt_198.endf: Fix mismatch between width in File 2 and
      File32 to allow to get covariance data in RR.  The uncertainty for the widht has
      been adjusted to keep the same relative value.

    * n-078_Pt_192.endf New File 2 and File 32 evaluations from Dimitri Rochman for Pt192
      to makes sure that File 2 and File 32 resonances are in sync.

    * n-078_Pt_195.endf: Fix metastable indices in Pt195. MF6 lists the 7th excited state
      (259 keV, t1/2 = 4 days) as metastable. MF8 has that state but also lists the 1st
      excited state (98 keV, t1/2 = 170ps), incorrectly labeled as the ground state.

    * n-078_Pt_197.endf: Like Pt195, 197 includes two metastables in MF8 but only one in
      MF6. Fix up LIP and LIS flags

    * n-078_Pt_190.endf, n-078_Pt_192.endf, n-078_Pt_194.endf, n-078_Pt_196.endf, n-078_Pt_198.endf
      Remove the URR covariance data from some of the Pt isotopes as the J valuse between
      File 32 and File 2 do not agree and the average resonance
      parameeters for one of the J value in File 32 are 0.

Added & corrected Ne evaluations from TENDL:

    * New files: n-010_Ne_020.endf, n-010_Ne_021.endf, n-010_Ne_022.endf

    * n-010_Ne_022.endf: Update the File 32 width for some resonances to the one given in
      File 2. The uncertainty for those width is recalculated to give the same relative
      uncertainty. For Ne22 URR covariance was removed.

    * n-010_Ne_020.endf: make MF32 resonance parameters match MF2; toss out off-diagonal
      terms in Ne20: they try to assign to matrix elements out of range!

Other assorted fixes:

    * n-094_Pu_240.endf: Several fixes:
        ** Fix resonance energies in MF=32 to match MF=2.
        ** Change the engy range of the incident energies for the chi covariance matrix
           (File 35) in Pu240 as per Denise Neudecker's recommendation.
        ** Change MF10 energy from 4.298000+4 to 4.297984+4 for consistency with MF3/MT51

    * n-022_Ti_048.endf: adjust the Q values of the MT=58 cross section to be
      consistent with ENSDF and the MF=12 data.

    * n-073_Ta_180.endf, n-073_Ta_181.endf, n-075_Re_185.endf, n-075_Re_187.endf
      Fix minor format issues in LLNL Ta and Re evaluations: MF=12 used LP=0 meaning
      'origin of photons not designated', but the origin is given in field ES on the same line.


ENDF/B-VIII.0beta4 (28 Feb 2017)
--------------------------------

CIELO evaluations:

    * n-001_H_001.endf: New version with standards cross section, tested in-house at LANL.
      Documentation and file-33 not updated yet

    * n-026_Fe_056.endf (IAEA file fe56ib20w.endf): Slightly revised version from
      previous, capture backround around 25 keV slightly reduced, but not zeroed.
      MACS(30 keV) = 13.97 mb, somewhat higher than KaDoNiS recommendation, but
      consistent with several MACS(30 keV) data sets.  This file also includes a few minor
      fixes in the fast region:
        - Fixed missing branching ratios for 56Fe and 57Fe levels in discrete-level file
          for Fe56. This should not affect any cross sections, only gammas.
        - Main changes were in order to improve agreement of high-energy (between ~ 50
          and 150 MeV) alpha production with exp. data. This was done by identifying which
          nuclei contribute the most to alpha emissions at 150 MeV and then fitted the
          level-density and alpha-emission tuning parameters for those nuclei. This fit
          was done through senstivity matrix calculations and Kalman.
        - Calculations were done with Rev. 4825 of EMPIRE.

    * n-092_U_235.endf: 3 Changes
      1 revision r1060: (IAEA u235ib36o28p6DNcnu5ef0STi) nu-bar below 75 eV increased by
        0.05% to compensate the loss of reactivity due to the new LANL hydrogen (STD 2016).
        U-235 resonance parameters were changed (ORNL RP file 28p) to decrease the slope
        of HST benchmarks vs ATLF.  Comments need updating
      2 revision r1071: (IAEA u235ib36o28t6DNcnu5ef0STm) (comments need update)
        Small changes to resonance parameters for consistency with Standards_2016 resonance
        fission integrals from 100 eV up to 1 keV, and a small change to nu-bar (from
        1-27 eV) to compensate the change in gradient with ATLF in HST benchmarks.
      3 revision r1071: (IAEA u235ib36o28t6DNcnu5ef0STs)
        The Standards were modified slightly and they affected benchmark performance.
        The U-238(n,f) cross section below the Standards region was defined on a finer
        mesh, so it was decided to adopt it (previously the ENDF/B-VI.8 was taken). The
        cross sections were made consistent with the new Standards in the "Standards"
        region, as well as in the region of "recommended" cross sections (pointwise or
        group-wise). This meant that U-235 and U-238 evaluations needed additional tuning.
        Small changes to nu-bar were made. The new PFNS of U-235 by D. Neudecker are
        included, as well as the fission gamma data from Stetcu (LANL).

    * n-092_U_238.endf; new version of U-238: (IAEA u238ib54lrlFsfaST4d)
      The Standards were modified slightly and they affected benchmark performance.
      The U-238(n,f) cross section below the Standards region was defined on a finer
      mesh, so it was decided to adopt it (previously the ENDF/B-VI.8 was taken). The
      cross sections were made consistent with the new Standards in the "Standards"
      region, as well as in the region of "recommended" cross sections (pointwise or
      group-wise). This meant that U-235 and U-238 evaluations needed additional tuning.
      Small changes to nu-bar were made. The new PFNS of U-235 by D. Neudecker are
      included, as well as the fission gamma data from Stetcu (LANL).

    * n-094_Pu_239.endf (IAEA File pu239e80b4_5_corDN (as submitted by D. Neudecker on 22
      February)) The file was made consistent with Standards_2017, including a correction
      to the PFNS for Einc = 17.5, 20 and 30 MeV (were missing).  In addition, the prompt
      nu-bar from 0.9 MeV to 6 MeV was adjusted.  Use a 1.002 factor
      at 1.0 MeV, with a linear ramp down to a 1.000 factor a 6.0 Mev.
      Make a corresponding change to total nu-bar.
        - This seemingly arbitrary change is easily accommodated by the
          spread in experimental data and yields better calculated PMF
          eigenvalues.
        - A more rigorous re-analysis of the existing experimental
          database remains a future task.


Other evaluations using Standards 2017 data:

    * n-003_Li_006.endf: New R-matrix analysis from G. Hale.  Results from a new R-matrix
      analysis of the 7Li system, done up to 4 MeV neutron energy, were included in this
      evaluation for MF=3, MT=1,2,105.  The results were obtained by fitting the (n,t)
      cross section that resulted from the 2016 GMA standards evaluation, along with data
      from other reactions in the 7Li sytem.

    * n-005_B_010.endf: New R-matrix analysis from G. Hale:
    1.  Standard (n,a) cross sections were fitted with R-matrix analy-
        sis at energies up to 1 MeV.
    2.  (n,a) cross sections were modified at higher energies to agree
        with data of Schrack (n,a1) and Gioginis (n,a).
    3.  Total cross section was modified at higher energies to better
        agree with data of Wasson (200 m) and of Abfalterer.
    4.  Capture cross section (3-102) was modified to agree with
        recent data from Firestone (thermal) and of Igashira (keVs).
    5.  Kornilov data for the (n,t) reaction were used in the R-
        matrix fit below 1 MeV; cross section (3-700) was unchanged
        at energies above 1 MeV.
    6.  Elastic neutron scattering angular distributions (4-2) changed
        below 1 MeV.  Angular distributions were also changed at
        energies below 1 MeV for the (n,a0) (6-800) and (n,a1) (6-801)
        reactions, and added for the (n,t) (6-700) reaction.
    7.  MT 605 (n,p') from the 5th excited state at 6263.3 keV does
        not decay by pair production.  The LR flag, previously set
        to 40 was changed to 0.

    * n-079_Au_197.endf (IAEA filename: au197STD-2017-final-11Feb17-vp.endf):
      New version of JEFF-3.3's Au-197 file with the Standards_2017 implemented, including
      - Extended the URR up to 2 keV and agreement with the LSD benchmark was additionally
        improved through an alternative use of the statistical and standard infinitely
        dilute capture cross section in the three regions 2-3.75 keV, 3.75-11.75 keV, and
        11.75-100 keV, by keeping continuity.
      - Below 2 keV all resolved resonance parameters were reevaluated based on
        measurements at n_TOF and GELINA.
      - This file is essentually ENDF/B-VII.1 above the resonance region but includes
        updated covariances.


Other notable changes:

    * n-017_Cl_035.endf:  This commit is motivated by the incorrect mass of the (n,p)
      particle-pair for which the mass of 35Cl was reported instead of the
      correct mass of 35S. The mass of the elastic particle-pair was also made
      consistent to that one reported in file 3.
      - Changes on the masses are based on the atomic mass evaluation 2012.
          1) correction of the mass for elastic particle-pair 35Cl (MT=2):
          2) correction of the mass for the (n,g) particle-pair 36Cl (MT=102)
          3) correction of the mass for the (n,p) particle-pair 35S (MT=600)
      - Additional correction on the charge number for the elastic
        particle-pair: the charge number was set to zero instead of Z=17.
        Luckily, this had no impact on the cross sections because for the
        elastic particle-pair the penetrability factors are independent from the
        charge number Z.
      - Changes 1),2) and 3) generated negligible changes on the cross sections
        when the cross sections for all reaction channels were reconstructed
        from file 2.
      - Note: the Q-value calculated with the masses of Atomic Mass Evaluation
        2012 is Q=615.0234 keV. This is slightly different from that reported in
        the current file Q= 615.2200 keV.

    * n-017_Cl_037.endf; MF=3, MT=102 #had 2 interpolation regions.  There was only 1
      interpolation region in MF=3, MT=1.  MF=3 MT=1 has been corrected to have 2
      interpolation regions.  We believe that this did not change any of the transport
      calculations because in AMPX  and NJOY the total cross section is calculated from
      the sum of the partials and therefore the error in MF=3 MT=1 should never have
      entered transport calculations.

    * n-026_Fe_054.endf: Merged fast file from CIELO Iron project rev. 412
      (Fast/fe54-CIELO.endf) with resonances from CIELO Iron project rev. 379 of
      Full/fe54-CIELO.endf.  This merged file has (n,p) and (n,2n) replaced by IRDFF.
      Added fluctuations in fast region by replacing (n,total) by JENDL-4.0 between
      1.036 MeV and 7.25 MeV. Reconstructed elastic for consistency.

    * n-026_Fe_057.endf; Merged fast file from CIELO Iron project rev. 397
      (Fast/fe57-CIELO.endf) with resonances from CIELO Iron project rev. 311 of
      Full/fe57-CIELO.endf.

    * n-026_Fe_058.endf: Merged fast file from CIELO Iron project rev. 396
      (Fast/fe58-CIELO.endf) with resonances from CIELO Iron project rev.244 of
      Full/fe58-CIELO.endf.  Rebuild with URR set for self-shielding only

    * n-029_Cu_063.endf: Resonance Parameter Covariance Matrix (file 32) has been added
      for the resonance parameters from the beta2 version.  RPCM has been calculated
      using the retroactive covariance matrix methodology of SAMMY and the unrealistically
      small uncertainties on the resonance parameters have been increased to calculate
      cross section uncertainties on the order of several percent for a 44 group cross
      section covariance matrix using a constant flux.

    * n-029_Cu_065.endf: Resonance Parameter Covariance Matrix (file 32) has been added
      for the resonance parameters from the beta2 version.  RPCM has been calculated
      using the retroactive covariance matrix methodology of SAMMY and the unrealistically
      small uncertainties on the resonance parameters have been increased to calculate
      cross section uncertainties on the order of several percent for a 44 group cross
      section covariance matrix using a constant flux.

    * n-033_As_074.endf: Set the URR use for self-shielding calculations only to
      avoid double counting of average cross section

    * n-094_Pu_240.endf (IAEA pu240e80b31c): Changed to improve MCF benchmarks and
      measured reaction rates (PROFIL).
        - Fission cross section updated: Replaced by Tovesson 2009 data from 5.7keV to 40
          keV (URR), Weston 40keV - 190keV.
        - Capture cross section taken from ENDF/B-VII.0 (=ENDF-B/VI.8), with an
          additional 2% reduction above 42 keV to improve Pu240ng measured reaction
          rates (PROFIL).  Also replaced Pu-240(n,g) above URR with ENDF/B-Vi.8, which is
          Weston’s evaluation, who also made the only measurement in this energy range.
        - Elastic cross section taken from ENDF/B-VII.0 (=ENDF-B/VI.8).

    * n-095_Am_241.endf: add an isotropic MF4/MT18 section to go with the PFNS


ENDF/B-VIII.0beta3.1 (19 Jan 2017)
----------------------------------

CIELO evaluations:

    * n-008_O_016.endf: new evaluation of capture cross section based on the R-matrix (up to
      2 MeV) and the DSD model in CoH3 (2 - 30 MeV).  Also 2 minor bugs were also fixed:
        - MF4 MT2, odd number of Legendre coefficient at 0.1 eV
        - different threshold energy of (n,alpha) in MF14

    * n-026_Fe_054.endf: Several changes:
        - Add in roughly 64 resonances from G. Giubrone’s thesis “Neutron capture
          measurement of 54Fe and 57Fe at CERN n_TOF”, University of Valencia (2014),
          noted in Atlas evaluation but missing from IRSN evaluation
        - Add high energy capture background to the RRR to account for missing p- & d-wave
          resonances

    * n-026_Fe_056.endf: New CIELO revision for Fe56, corresponding to IAEA version
      fe56ib19v.  Major change: The elastic angular distributions in the resolved
      resonance range are taken from resolution-broadened Perey data.  Above the resonance
      range up to 2.5 MeV the angular distributions correspond to re-fitted Kinney data
      with some adjustments based on the comparison with Perey data in the overlapping
      region. In the range 2.5-4.0 MeV the angular distributions are taken from Smith
      (1973). Above 2.5 MeV the angular distributions are from the Empire calculation.

    * n-092_U_235.endf: CIELO evaluations for 235,238U including new standards evaluation
      and PFNS

    * n-092_U_238.endf: CIELO evaluations for 235,238U including new standards evaluation
      and PFNS

    * n-094_Pu_239.endf: New CIELO evaluation.   It contains:
        - The final prompt fission gamma rays from I. Stetcu
        - T. Kawano’s results for  gamma-ray production from all channels other than fission
        - (n,2n) tweak near the threshold and below 8 MeV
        - (n,f) cross section adjusted to the final standards released on Dec. 14, 2016
      It does NOT contain the P(nu;Einc) evaluation yet, as LANL decided it is better to
      keep those for beta5 instead.


New or mostly new evaluations:

    * n-004_Be_009.endf: New LANL 9Be evaluation

    * n-006_C_013.endf: New 13C evaluation from LANL

    * n-079_Au_197.endf: Proposed evaluation: based on ENDF/B-VII.1 cross sections in
      the fast energy range and resonance parameters evaluated at IRMM

    * n-092_U_233.endf: Replace with CIELO project version: JENDL-4.0 + updated resonances
      to get thermal cross sections + LANL PFNS


Other notable changes:

    * Reverted n-029_Cu_063.endf and n-029_Cu_065.endf to their beta2 versions due to
      poor performance of the beta3 version in critical assembly benchmarks

    * n-094_Pu_240.endf:
        - Adjusted the negative (bound) levels of the Resolved Resonance
          Region (RRR) evaluation (File 2) with evaluation code SAMMY
          (Larson) to better match the thermal cross section values
          found in the Atlas of Neutron Resonances (Mughabghab).
        - The Resonance parameter covariance matrix (File 32) was adjusted
          accordingly to preserve the relative uncertainty on the cross
          section of the original evaluation of Derrien et. al.  In File
          32, non-zero uncertainty is reported for zero fission widths of
          the 2 spin groups associated with p-wave resonances.  12 of
          those variances were negative and were changed to be the
          corresponding positive value.

    * n-095_Am_241.endf: The (n,n'), (n,2n), (n,3n), (n,4n), and capture cross sections
      updated based on a new CoH3 calculation.  The MF=6 sections corresponding to the new
      cross sections are also provided including complete photon production information.

    * n-095_Am_243.endf:
        - The prompt fission spectrum replaced by JENDL-4.
        - Stop the RRR at 50 keV rather than 250 keV and extend the URR down to 50 keV.
          There were no resonances above 250 keV to provide a background for the
          resonances from 80-250 keV, so we had a strange dip in the reconstructed cross
          section.  The URR extension does a reasonable job matching the average cross
          section.  This resolves tracker item #1043.

    * n-099_Es_254m1.endf: Correct the ZA in MF=31 data, was set to 9.925410+4

    * Remove sign from channel spin in new LRF=7 evaluations (per CSEWG 2016 format
      discussion): n-020_Ca_040.endf, n-029_Cu_063.endf, n-029_Cu_065.endf,
      n-074_W_183.endf



ENDF/B-VIII.0beta3 (1 Nov 2016)
-------------------------------

CIELO evaluations:

    * n-026_Fe_054.endf: New Fe54 evaluation with the following:
        1) IRSN resonances up to 1.036 MeV
        2) New EMPIRE calculation from 1.036 MeV - 150 MeV
        3) (n,2n), (n,p) and (n,a) cross sections taken from IRDFF, partial reactions
           scaled to match these totals

    * n-026_Fe_056.endf: IAEA file fe56ib18b, IAEA-BNL Collaboration for CIELO:
        - Resolved resonance range up to 850 keV basically from JENDL-4.0
        - The resonance energy at 766.7 kev was corrected.
        - The background near 800 keV was reduced by 50 percent.
        - Artificial "background" was added to capture around 24.5 keV,
          since capture in the hole of the elastic seems to be low and is
          HIGHLY SENSITIVE to many benchmarks. It was stipulated thet the
          broad dip in this energy region is caused by inappropriately
          placed bound states. The adjusted capture cross section now
          follows the 1/v behaviour.
        - The total cross section above the resonance range was taken
          from JEFF-3.2 because it is consistent with the Berthold
          measurements on Fe-nat. The contribution of the minor isotopes
          is taken into account.
        - The capture cross sections above 860 keV were taken from the
          RPI data presented by Y. Danon at the ND2016 Conference.
        - JEFF-3.2 contains inelastic cross sections measured by Dupont
          et al., but the authors discovered normalisation problems and
          the results were never published. New measurements were
          performed by Negret, but with a lower resolution. The Dupont
          and Negret data were binned over a suitable energy mesh.
          A piecewise linear scaling parameter was constructed to adjust
          Dupont data such that they agree on average with the Negret
          data. It was also found that the energy calibration of Negret
          data did not match the resonances of the total cross section.
          A correction was made to the energy scale which amounted to
          2.5 keV at 1.8 MeV. Inelastic cross sections between 0.85e6
          and 3.5e6 eV are taken from JEFF-3.2.
        - The elastic cross section is defined as the difference between
          the total and the remaining partial cross sections. By
          resolution-broadening of the elastic cross section to
          0.3 percent, good agreement is observed with the measured
          Kinney data.
        - The elastic angular distributions in the resolved resonance
          range were reconstructed from the resonance parameters.
          The Legendre moments were resolution-broadened with a
          resolution function of constant width of 1 keV. For most
          applications the resolution-broadened Legendre coefficients
          are sufficient, but the user still has the option to
          reconstruct detailed distributions from the resonance
          parameters.
          Above the resonance range up to 4 MeV the angular distributions
          were taken from JEFF-3.2 because they accurately follow the
          Kinney data (with a correction for the minor isotopes).
        - The P2 Legendre coefficients of elastic scattering were
          increased linearl, starting with 0 at 0.3 MeV,
          peaking to 0.7 at 0.85 MeV and ending with 0 at 1.5 MeV.
        - Similarly, the P4 Legendre coefficients of elastic scattering
          were increased linearly, starting with 0 at 0.5 MeV,
          peaking to 0.2 at 0.85 MeV and ending with 0 at 1.5 MeV.
        - At higher energies all cross sections, angular distributions
          and spectra are taken from EMPIRE calculation, which was tuned
          to reproduce the important reaction channels and radionuclide
          production data.

    * n-026_Fe_057.endf:  Fe57 revised with new EMPIRE calculation for fast region

    * n-094_Pu_239.endf: October 31, 2016 Major update...

        *** MF1, MT456/452: Prompt and total neutron multiplicities are replaced by the
            original results from the statistical analysis of experimental data by P.G.
            Young using the GLUCS code. The modification introduced in the fast energy
            range for the average prompt neutron multiplicity in the ENDF/B-VII library
            is removed. The average total neutron multiplicity is adjusted accordingly.

        *** MF3, MT18: The fission cross section evaluated as part of the 2016 standard
            evaluation is adopted here above 40 keV and up to 20 MeV.

        *** MF3, MT102: The capture cross section follows the recent modification of
            ENDF/B-VII.1 above 30 keV to better match recent DANCE data by Mosby et al.
            [Mo16] up to 0.7 MeV, where it switches to Kawano's CoH3 calculations [Ka16]
            up to 3.7 MeV. For now (to be replaced), from 3.7 to 20 MeV, it then matches
            the previous ENDF/B-VII.1 evaluation.

        *** MF5, MT18: The PFNS was obtained from an evaluation by Neudecker et al. [Ne16]
            extending the original Los Alamos model to include the effects of emission
            anisotropy and different fragment temperatures, as well as to properly account
            for multi-chance fission evaporation and pre-equilibrium neutron spectra. The
            thermal PFNS was obtained by averaging the ENDF/B-VII.1 PFNS with a slightly
            modified PFNS by Romano.

ENDF/B-VIII.0beta2 (19 Aug 2016)
--------------------------------

CIELO evaluations:

    * n-026_Fe_054.endf: Revised 54Fe from the CIELO project.  This evaluation includes
      revised resonance region from IRSN up to 1.2 MeV in the LRF=7 format, EMPIRE

    * n-092_U_235.endf: CIELO 235U file u235ib18o23g6cnu5ef1 from
      `https://www-nds.iaea.org/CIELO/`, product of an ORNL, LANL and IAEA collaboration.
      Major components of evaluation:
         - Empire calculation 'ib18' (capture at upper limit of Jandel)

         - Improved fit of Kammerdiener ddx at 14 MeV

         - Resonance parameters ORNL version 'o23'

           based on Reed data from C00-3058-39, normalized to thermal
           value of 2,41161. Simon data were measured rel.to 252Cf(sf)
           normalized at 10-27 eV on Reed's data (10-Jan-2016)
           The dip in the data around 30 eV was suppressed.

         - Delayed nu-bar and spectra from ENDF/B-VII.1

    * n-092_U_238.endf: CIELO 238U file ib46rlFs from
      `https://www-nds.iaea.org/CIELO/`, product of an IRMM, LANL and IAEA collaboration.
      General information:

      Note: 'ib46'='ib45' with (n,3n) exclusive and cleaner formatting.  This
      revision includes a fix to unit conversion problem on 2nd-order coefficients
      from MT458 fission energy release.

    * n-094_Pu_239.endf: CIELO file pu239lanlmbc2v from `https://www-nds.iaea.org/CIELO/`,
      product of an IRMM, LANL and IAEA collaboration.  General information:

        - Fix unit conversion problem on 2nd-order coefficients from MT458 fission energy
          release.

        - Changed to LSSF=1 in URR

        - Replace capture (mf3,mt102) above 30 keV with new modification
          from Chadwick to follow Mosby data. Modify elastic (mf3,mt2)
          to preserve total x/s.

        - Replace "Romano" thermal pfns tweak with an alternate tweak
          that is the average of the Romano+original e71 thermal pfns.

Other notable changes:

    * n-004_Be_007.endf: Fix outgoing alpha multiplicities for n+Be7->a+a
      (two alpha products are listed, so each should have multiplicity=1)

    * n-006_C_012.endf: 2 fixes:
        1. ZAI in the first isotope in the resonance region was set to 6000, not 6012

        2. For the (n,n') levels, QM should have been all set to 0.0 MeV, QI should
           have been set to the -(level energy)

    * n-006_C_013.endf: Revised 13C evaluation from M. Paris and G. Hale.  This new
      evaluation of the n+13C reactions is based on a six-channel R-matrix analysis of
      reactions in the 14C system at energies up to 20 MeV.  Data included were total
      cross sections and angular distributions up to 5 MeV. A fair fit is obtained to
      the 3676 data points included.

    * n-020_Ca_040.endf: Ca-40  resolved resonance evaluation, performed in energy range
      from 1e-5 eV to 1.5 MeV with the SAMMY code in ORNL.  Resonance parameter covariance
      matrices were also obtained in the SAMMY evaluation process in the energy region up
      to 1.5 MeV.  The RML formalism (LRF=7) was used for the resonance parameters
      and the formalism (LCOMP=1) for the covariance matrix.  Thermal cross sections (for
      reconstructed cross sections at T=293.6 K) are: Total 3.075396 b, (n,g) 2.662938 b,
      (n,el) 0.409977 b, and (n,a) 0.002481 b.

    * n-029_Cu_063.endf, n-029_Cu_065.endf from ORNL, LANL collaboration:
        - Updated resolved resonance region evaluation for cu63 and cu65.
          The high energy capture data normalization has been corrected and the
          resonance parameters refitted to eliminate the dip of the
          capture cross section at the end of the resolved resonance region.

          Angular distribution data for elastic scattering for incident neutron
          energies between 1e-5 eV and 300 keV should be calculated directly
          from the resonance parameters in File 2 using the Blatt and Biedenharn
          formalism, if the capabilities of the processing code permit.  Otherwise, the
          coefficients of the expansion of the angular distribution in the Legendre
          moments have been provided in File 4 on a reduced energy grid sufficient
          to maintain comparable performance in neutron transport calculations.

        - Collaboration work is on going with LANL to smooth the transition from the
          resolved resonance region (File 2) to the high energy region (File 3)
          in both angle integrated cross sections and distributions of elastic
          scattering with a schedule completion date of Nov, 2016.  The upper resonance
          boundary was temporally changed to 100keV, and LANL evaluation concatenated

        - The covariance part of the evaluation has been removed just for the beta2 testing
          version.  New resonance parameter covariance matrices will be added once the
          synchronization of the resonance region with the high energy region is complete.


    * n-033_As_073.endf: New evaluation from T.Kawano, including some fixes:
        - Make sure the number of gammas is equal in corresponding MF12 and MF14 files
          Get BR's of some MF12 levels to sum up to 1.0

        - First (n,p) excited state in MF=3 had wrong energy.  Note: this file is missing
          the second (n,p) state in MF=3, but has it in MF=12 so MF=3 & MF=12 are out of
          sync

        - Fix mismatches between excited state energies for As73 (n,p*) reactions.

    * n-093_Np_236m1.endf: Fix unit conversion problem on 2nd-order coefficients
      from MT458 fission energy release.

* Final 54Fe from CIELO Iron project (rev. 246 of CIELO Iron project)

* Final CIELO 56Fe before WPEC meetings (rev. 246 of CIELO Iron project)

* Revert prompt and total nu-bar (MF1 MT456, 452) to ENDF/B-VII.1 values for
  ENDF/B-VIII beta1 release.  This allows for establishing a baseline for future
  improvements.

* Bug fixes in several files (n-008_O_016.endf, n-006_C_013.endf, n-092_U_235.endf,
  n-007_N_015.endf, n-026_Fe_054.endf)



ENDF/B-VIII.0beta0 (8 Apr 2016)
-------------------------------

CIELO evaluations:

    * n-001_H_001.endf:

        ** Comment section modified slightly to avoid confusions (T. Kawano).

        ** Covariance data replaced by Hale's high fidelity evaluation (T. Kawano).

    * n-008_O_016.endf: CIELO 16O file from G. Hale, et al. (LANL)

    * n-026_Fe_056.endf: CIELO 56Fe file from BNL, IAEA and CNDC

    * n-092_U_235.endf: CIELO 235U file. From IAEA, LANL, ...

        ** Added a delayed neutron multiplicity covariance matrix (MF=31,MT=455) using a
           least-square fit of available data. The total neutron multiplicity covariance
           matrix (MF=31,MT=452) is now inferred from the prompt (MT=456) and delayed
           (MT=455). It fixes a problem observed with very large uncertainties in the total
           neutron multiplicity in the thermal and URR regions.  (P. Talou)

    * n-092_U_238.endf: CIELO 238U file.  Documentation needs updating.  From IAEA, LANL, ...

    * n-094_Pu_239.endf: CIELO 239Pu evaluation.  From IAEA, LANL, ORNL, IRSN, ...

        ** Fixed a small error in prompt fission neutron spectrum (MF5,MT18), where the
           16.0 MeV incident neutron energy is replaced by 17.5 MeV. (P. Talou)

        ** Fixed zero uncertainty in prompt nu-bar covariance matrix (MF31,MT456) at first
           energy point. The same fix was applied to the covariance matrix for the total
           nu-bar (MF31,MT452). (P. Talou)

        ** Updated evaluation in the resolved range for 239-Pu (L. Luiz et al., ORNL)
           Features of the evaluation:

             1. One single set of resonances parameters covering the energy
                range from 0.00001 eV to 2.5 keV.

             2. SAMMY (Reich-Moore) analysis of the experimental data led to
                a set of resonance parameters that fit well the experimental
                data and improves benchmark calculations in the thermal
                region.

             3. Integral quantities such as K1 and eta (nu*capture/fission)
                were the two major indicators on how to fix the problem with
                thermal benchmark results.

             4. Experimental data used in the previous Pu-239 resonance
                were used. The experimental data were well represented
                with the new resonance evaluation.


New full evaluations:

    * Add neutron evaluation (yes, that's neutron as a target)

    * Add 18O evaluation from ROSFUND library, fix total width of 4.09 MeV resonance
      (was off by factor of 10 from sum of GN and GG), adjust lower limit of MT102 (capture)
      to eliminate a whole in the reconstructed capture cross section and adjust the total
      cross section to account for this modification

    * Add minor Fe isotopes from the CIELO collaboration (54Fe, 57Fe and 58Fe).   New
      fast regions in all from EMPIRE calculations.  New (currently undocumented)
      resonance regions in all:

        ** 54Fe, new Atlas values, in Reich-Moore format

        Resolved resonance parameter evaluation for Cu-63 was done with the computer code SAMMY.
        The following data were used in the SAMMY analysis.

              Reference   |   Energy (eV)     | Facility | Measurement

        The MITR transmission measurements were important for determining the shape and
        the uncertainty of the thermal cross section.

        A set of resonance parameter describing the experimental data was obtained.
        Resonance parameter covariance matrices were also obtained in the SAMMY evaluation process.
        The upper energy boundary of the resonance region of Cu-63 was extended from 99.5 keV to 300 keV.

        Angular distribution data for elastic scattering for incident neutron energies
        between 1e-5 eV and 300 keV were generated directely from the new resonance parameters
        in File 2 on a fine energy grid. The new elastic scattering angular distribution data gives
        a much more detailed treatment of the angular distribution than previous evaluations.

Fixes:

    * n-001_H_003.endf: Fixing incorrect reference #3 (wrong journal/page numbers) (C. Mattoon)

    * n-006_C_000.endf: Since the MT=5 cross section is zero at and below 2e7, set the
      neutron multiplicity to zero as well. (B. Beck)

    * n-005_B_011.endf: Several fixes:

        ** T. Kawano recomputed the elastic angular distribution with the same
           optical model, but with higher Lmax. This resolves tracker #925

        ** For MT=102, the number of g's in MF=14 was 5.  It should have been 9 like in MF=12.

    * n-009_F_019.endf: Fix count of gammas in MT=102

    * n-011_Na_023.endf: Update NK in MF=14 MT=102 to agree with MF=12 MT=102

    * n-017_Cl_035.endf: Several fixes:

        ** Tweaked the (n,p) background cross section by one point to remove a
           discontinuity and resolve tracker item #845 (T. Kawano)

        ** Fix top end of MF=12 MT=102 gamma multiplicities: incorrectly entered as
           2.000000+0 instead of 2.000000+7 (C. Mattoon)

    * n-017_Cl_037.endf: Several fixes:

        ** Fix top end of MF=12 MT=102 gamma multiplicities: incorrectly entered as
           2.000000+0 instead of 2.000000+7 (C. Mattoon)

    * n-020_Ca_040.endf: Fix the gap in the transition from the RR to the
      high energy region.  This resolves the second half of tracker item #709 (C. Mattoon)

    * n-027_Co_058.endf: Resolve the Co58 half of issue #709 with Caleb Mattoon's patch --
      it appears that the transition between RR and high energy region was goofed up,
      so Caleb patched the transition.

    * n-028_Ni_058.endf: All cross sections above the resonance regions were upgraded (T. Kawano)

    * n-028_Ni_059.endf: All cross sections above the resonance regions were upgraded (T. Kawano)

    * n-036_Kr_078.endf: Fix background cross sections in resonance region (C. Mattoon)

    * n-029_Cu_065.endf:  The range of the resolved range in 65-Cu was erraneously set
      to 1.3e6 eV instead of 3e5 eV.  This update fixes this error. We also eliminated
      repeated zeros in file 3 for the RR range (D. Wiarda)

    * n-030_Zn_068.endf: MF9 weights were incorrect in that they should have extended up to
      the first excited state (2.1 MeV) rather than the upper end of the MF=3 domain (2.0 MeV)
      (C. Mattoon)

    * n-038_Sr_088.endf: Revised 7 resonance widths that appear to have been mistranscribed
      when translating from the Atlas of Neutron Resonance into END/B-VII:

            26.98 keV Gn, three orders smaller than what it should be.
            73.77 keV Gn, three orders smaller than what it should be.
            75.5 keV  Gg, three orders smaller than what it should be.

            268 keV Gn, three orders smaller than what it should be.
            297.8 keV Gg, three orders smaller than what it should be.

        This problem was noted by Tatsuya Katabuchi (JAEA)

      The MT51, MF3 level energy didn't agree with those in MFs 8. 10 and 40.  We picked the
      level recommended by ENSDF

    * n-045_Rh_105.endf: Adopt 105Rh from JENDL-4.0.  The JENDL-3.2 evaluation and the
      ENDF/B-VII.1 evaluation were identical and both a result of the WPEC/SG-23 project.
      The JENDL-4.0 update revised the resonance region, fixing a long standing bug with the
      resonance spin assignments

    * n-050_Sn_120.endf: Adjust the gamma branching ratios out of level 18 (MT=68) so they
      sum to 1, high energy part replaced by new CoH3 calculations to fix the reported energy
      balance problem.

    * n-050_Sn_122.endf: Fix typo in original formatting of resonances during translation
      from the Atlas to ENDF.  This eliminates several warnings from PSYCHE and partly

        ** (n,g)'s gamma multiplicity table (MT102, MF6, very top of MF) had
           zero gamma multiplicity at Ein=10e-5 eV.

        ** Copied down Ein=1 keV multiplicity (4.12535) and resolved a tracker item.

        ** Energy spectra and angular distributions recalculated using CoH

    * n-069_Tm_168.endf: Fix MF=6 MT=102, first energy point was replaced by an actual
      distribution, which is the same of the next incident energy (30eV), but with 30eV
      subtracted in the last two outgoing energies (G. Nobre).

    * n-073_Ta_180.endf: Recalculate the (n,tot) cross section with the correct energy grid
      that avoids interpolations troubles (I. Thompson)

      Am244 is the 2nd excited level, not the first

    * LFS indicates final level index (not metastable number) in the residual. Several files
      had LFS=1 for metastables that are actually higher states: (n-025_Mn_055.endf,
